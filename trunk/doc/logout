After sending REQUEST and receiving CHALLENGE, we send a logout request packet:

struct drcom_logout_packet
{
  struct drcom_host_header host_header;
  char username[36];
  u_int8_t unknown0;
  u_int8_t mac_code;
  u_int8_t mac_xor[6];
  struct drcom_auth auth_info;
} __attribute__ ((__packed__));

pkt_type is 06 01.

len is strlen(username) + sizeof(struct drcom_host_header).

unknown0 is 0x18 (as in drcom_login_packet).
